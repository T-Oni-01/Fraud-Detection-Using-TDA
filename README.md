# Fraud-Detection-Using-TDA
AI Machine Learning &amp; TDA to detect likely fraud in financial transactions

Hello,
This is a passion research I later used in one of my reseaarch classes. It involves investigating the use of Topological Data Analysis to detect likely fraud in financial transactions.

Here is a summary:
Topological Data Analysis will quantify data into shapes and structures to identify patterns that may not be apparent through conventional methods.

In combination with either supervised or unsupervised machine learning models, I believe it is possible to accurately detect potential scam transactions using appropriate metrics such as F1 score (depending on which approach I take).

The general goal is to load a series of financial transaction data into our database, parse the data, and then apply TDA to create a mapper graph that would train the learning model to determine likely fraudulent/high anomaly transactions.
